# Outlier-Detection-Anomaly-Detection
Anomaly detection is extremely challenging in medical field, as anomalies/outliers project major drawbacks in the results obtained. Thus, removal of outliers not only improves the prognosis procedure but also helps to learns new information about the data. In this work, we propose to address the problem of anomaly detection using autoencoders.
